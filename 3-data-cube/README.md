# Data cube

### 1. Definition

**Data cube** is a multi-dimensional ("n-D") array of values. Typically, the term datacube is applied in contexts where these arrays are massively larger than the hosting computer's main memory; examples include multi-Terabyte/Petabyte data warehouses and time series of image data.

### 2. Data cube and Python

I finded many interesting links for implementation data cube with python.

- [Cubes - OLAP Framework](https://pythonhosted.org/cubes/)

First, i created 3D-array with numpy. [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/starting-big-data/blob/master/3-data-cube/1-data-cube-simple-sample.ipynb)
