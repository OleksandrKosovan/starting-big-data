# Data cube

### 1. Definition

**Data cube** is a multi-dimensional ("n-D") array of values. Typically, the term datacube is applied in contexts where these arrays are massively larger than the hosting computer's main memory; examples include multi-Terabyte/Petabyte data warehouses and time series of image data.
